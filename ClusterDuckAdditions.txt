Before you start to install the ESP32 board support package for the Arduino
IDE and the ClusterDuck-Protocol libraries, you should install some tools
that are needed for the builder to work correctly:

First install some tools:

**** Someone who uses CentOS and Arch should check these commands below.****

 Ubuntu and Debian:

    Some older versions Ubuntu and Debian are still providing Python 2.7 as
    the default interpreter but Python version 2 is now obsolete so we need
    to install Python 3 and it's support packages.  If you already have
    Python 3 installed this will not hurt anything if you don't it will
    install it.  Python 3 is recommended and can be installed as follows:

    sudo apt-get install git wget flex bison gperf python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util

    pip3 install pyserial

    Making Python 3 the default interpreter is possible, this is a system
    wide change. Run:

    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10


 CentOS 7:

    sudo yum install git wget python3 flex bison gperf cmake ninja-build ccache dfu-util

 Arch:

    sudo pacman -S --needed gcc git make flex bison gperf python-pip cmake ninja ccache dfu-util

Most of the ESP32 boards use /dev/ttyUSB* for their serial ports.  You will
need to have permissions to use the serial ports, on most Linux
distributions you can enable this by:

Adding user to dialout on Linux

The currently logged user should have read and write access the serial port
over USB.  On most Linux distributions, this is done by adding the user to
dialout group with the following commands:

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

on Arch Linux this is done slightly differently by adding the user to uucp
group with the following command:

sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER

Next install the board support package for the ESP32 boards
and then install the ClusterDuck-Protocol libraries by following the
directions below.

Make sure you log out and re-login to enable read and write permissions for
the serial port to take effect.  If you do not log out and log back in, you
will not have access to the serial ports until you do.
